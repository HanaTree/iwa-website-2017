                   The flagship IWA DIPCON offers a range of Exhibition/Sponsorship packages allowing you to tailor your organization's involvement and maximize your corporate exposure. Your organization will appear as a major industry player to delegates and other exhibitors/sponsors during the event, making a great contribution to your marketing plan. The benefits of exhibition/sponsoring go well beyond the conference – cement your products and services as the ‘go-to’ brand for water professionals. You will take advantage of branding rights, targeted IWA promotions, online and media exposure.
